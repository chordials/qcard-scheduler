QCARDING

On how the schedule works:
 - If everyone does their responsibilities, we should cover almost all of the campus "hubs" every day.
 - The schedule should minimize the amount that you have to walk between classes and quarter carding location.
 - The schedule limits people to 3 places a day and 10 places a week, which we think is fair.
 - If you have only a small chunk of free time, the schedule limits the places you have to qcard, so you should always have time to do whats written.
 - NOTE: If the schedule doesn't do any of these things in your opinion, let me know. If this works I can use feedback to improve this even more and we can use it next semester.

Rules of thumb:
 - When we say to "quarter card" a location, that means to leave a quarter card on every table.
 - Quarter carding doesn't have to be personal. As Blake said, I have left a quarter card on his table without him or me realizing.
 - Usually just the act of leaving a qcard will make people look at it/read it.

Goals with this method of qcarding:
 - People see Cocktail Hour XXII everywhere. When their friends ask them to go with them, that will register with them.
 - People don't throw away our qcards after getting them. At the worst, no one picks them up and whoever sits at the table after might look at them.
 - It saves us from spending a long time outside having uncomfortable interactions with people, while hopefully having the same effectiveness.

How to most effectively use schedule:
 - Quarter card places at the times that the schedule specifies or earlier. Qcards get thrown out around campus after 5pm.
 - If you miss one of your times on the schedule and you have free time before 4pm, go qcard it. Its not as good as the earlier times, but it's better than nothing.

How to most effectively quarter card:
 - If you are placing a qcard on a table, it feels appropriate, and you know the name of the person sitting there, say something about our concert. A personal connection goes a long way.
 - Don't miss a table. Even if people are having a meeting, I promise they will not get mad if you just politely slip a qcard on the side of their table.
 - Just one idea of many: if you want buy some candy and leave a piece or two with every qcard. It gets people's attention.

Keeping track:
 - Following the schedule isn't optional, so make it routine and follow it.
 - There will be a Google sheet with your times and places so that you can check off whenever you qcard somewhere
 - Honor system: Check off the sheet when you've qcarded a place and be honest. We trust you and this is just to get people at our concert which makes it SO much more fun for us.
 - If you miss a responsibility, it will be worth half a point.

Extra Credit:
 - There is a list of places that will not be qcarded by anyone on specified days. If you qcard one of these before 2pm, check it off in the sheet with your name and you'll get half a point back on this.
